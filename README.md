Welcome to RecipeGenerator!


By Austin Toma and Sebastian Hakim

Instructions:
There is a search bar at the top of the screen where you can type in what recipe you are interested in.

Simply type in what you want to eat and filter your search based on any dietary restrictons or allergies.

Once that is complete, click on your preferred recipe option and you will see the ingredients needed to make the meal.

Description:
We built a “recipe generator” that provides meal options, a recipe, and ingredients needed to make the meal. 

This code accesses an API for recipes, ingredients, and images.

We built this app because we both wanted to build something creative and challenging. 

This project is be useful for many people with dietary restrictions and allergies because they are able to filter the generator with any 
dietary restrictions or allergies they may have(for example, vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free diets).
